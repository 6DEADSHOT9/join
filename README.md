Would you like an EU badge on your GitHub profile?

## Getting the badge

The "badge" is nothing more than a label that you're a part of the `eu` team. To join the team:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/eu/join/issues) and add the label `join`
2. Write a little message and open the issue! Write a poem, say hello, or just send it blank

I'll add you within 24 hours. Or I'll do my best. Life happens.

## Enabling the badge

To enable the badge:

0. Click the link in the email you'll receive from GitHub asking you if you'd like to join the organization
1. Go to the [eu organization](https://github.com/eu)
2. Click "People"
3. Search for your name in the list
4. Click the "Private" lock next to your name
5. Select "Public" from the dropdown

That's it! You'll now have the icon displayed on your GitHub profile.
